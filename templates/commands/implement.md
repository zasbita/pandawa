## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Interactive Clarification (ask when blocked or unsure)

When you cannot resolve a decision confidently from tasks.md, plan.md, the code, or project conventions, ask the user instead of guessing or looping:

- **Ask when** the decision is high-impact or hard to reverse (architecture fit, data-model / schema strategy, breaking API changes, security, deleting or overwriting existing files), a required spec/file/input is missing, or the phase self-fix loop (step 8) has been exhausted on a blocking error.
- **How**: pause and ask ONE specific question at a time. State your recommended option with a one-line reason, then give 2–4 concrete choices plus a short free-form alternative; the user may accept the recommendation by replying "yes" (same style as `/pandawa.clarify`).
- **Proceed without asking** when the choice is low-impact and reversible or has a clear conventional default — pick the sensible default, record the assumption in `implementation-log.md`, and continue. Do not interrogate the user over trivia.
- **Bounded (no wait-loop)**: ask at most twice per decision. If still unresolved, apply your recommended default, log it as an assumption for review, and move on — never block indefinitely.
- **Non-interactive sessions** (CI, `pandawa run`, headless): never block on a question — apply the documented default, flag the assumption prominently in the final report, and continue.

## Outline

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

   **Path resolution rules (STRICT)**:
   - Resolve the repo root ONCE at the start (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` or the script output) and derive every file path from it as an absolute path. Never pass relative paths to file tools or scripts.
   - If a file or directory referenced by tasks.md/plan.md cannot be found, do NOT abort the whole run: report the unresolved path with a clear message (expected path, what referenced it, closest existing match), skip only the affected task(s), and continue with the rest.
   - When a task must create a file in a directory that does not exist yet, create the directory first — a missing folder is not an error.

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Run the helper (avoids PowerShell pipe-escaping of `|` in `Write-Host`):
     - Bash: `.pandawa/scripts/bash/check-checklists.sh --json` (or without `--json` for markdown table)
     - PowerShell: `.pandawa/scripts/powershell/check-checklists.ps1 -Json`
   - The helper scans `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/*.md`, counts per file `total/completed/incomplete` via `^\s*-\s*\[[ xX]\]` and returns JSON `{checklists:[{file,total,completed,incomplete,status}],overall,total,completed,incomplete}`. It handles `|` safely — do **not** reconstruct the table via `Write-Host "| Checklist | ..."` or `Get-Content ... | Select-String '- \[x\]' | Measure-Object` with raw pipes; use the helper and, if you need a table, write via temp file or `Write-Output` without `|` escaping issues.
   - `overall` is `PASS` only if every checklist has 0 incomplete; else `FAIL`.
   - **If `overall == FAIL`**:
     - Display the helper's table/JSON
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3
   - **If `overall == PASS`**:
     - Display the helper output showing all passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **REQUIRED**: Honor the plan's **Architecture Type** and **Integration Target**. If plan.md lacks these fields, detect them now: read the agent context file (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`), architecture docs (`docs/architecture*`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, ADRs), and build config (module federation / micro-frontend setup, monorepo layout). Generated code MUST fit the detected architecture — e.g., a micro-frontend remote wired into the host shell, never a standalone app when the project is federated. If architecture is genuinely undeterminable, STOP and ask the user before generating frontend/backend scaffolding.
   - **REQUIRED for any task touching UI**: Honor the plan's **Existing Design System** field. If plan.md lacks it (older plan, or the plan step was skipped), detect it now the same way: sample existing pages/components for the component library actually in use, the theme/token source, and the icon set. Build every new page/component with that existing library/tokens/icons — never introduce a second, unrelated design system alongside what the repo already has. Only fall back to a domain profile's own reference design system when the field says "None found — greenfield frontend" (a genuinely new frontend with nothing to match yet).
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships — the database schema follows data-model.md, which mirrors the source resource model; it deviates from that shape ONLY where data-model.md explicitly records a user-approved, lossless mapping
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   - **REQUIRED — requirement-coverage precondition (hard gate)**: read spec.md's Functional Requirements and Success Criteria, then confirm coverage: every `FR-###` is cited by at least one task in tasks.md (tasks carry `[FR-###]` citations — see `/pandawa.tasks`), and every `SC-###` is achievable by the tasks present (tasks do NOT cite SC IDs, so map each SC to the tasks/FRs that satisfy it by inference). If any `FR-###` has zero task citations, or any `SC-###` has no tasks that would achieve it, do NOT start implementing: either add the missing task(s), or obtain an explicit user waiver recording that requirement as out-of-scope (log it in implementation-log.md). Silently implementing a spec with uncovered requirements is a gate failure.
   - **REQUIRED for any task touching UI**: read the spec's **UI/UX & Screens** section (and the plan's carried-forward copy) and build each screen to that intent — the screen inventory, per-screen states (loading/empty/error/populated), and primary interactions — not just generic FE-011 element compliance.

    **Implementation checkpoint (change tracking)**:
   - Before writing any code, record a rollback point: on a git repo, ensure the working tree state is captured (note the current HEAD; if there are uncommitted changes, tell the user and offer to commit or stash them first).
   - Create/append `FEATURE_DIR/implementation-log.md` with a session header (date, HEAD commit, tasks targeted). After each completed task, append one line: task ID, files created/modified, and a short note. This is the audit trail used for review and rollback.
   - **Task marker automation**: after each phase (or at end), run the helper to sync `tasks.md` checkboxes from the log instead of manual regex — PowerShell: `.pandawa/scripts/powershell/update-tasks.ps1 -FromLog` (or `-TaskIds T001,T002 -Status done`), Bash: `.pandawa/scripts/bash/update-tasks.sh --from-log` — it writes `- [X] T00x [done]` with LF without BOM and is PS 5.1 compat (no `head`/`&&`).
   - **Windows PowerShell writing note**: avoid `Add-Content ... -Value @"` with embedded `"` and `|` (parser error `Missing expression after unary operator '-'`) — use `Set-Content -Encoding utf8NoBOM` / `Add-Content` with single-quoted strings or a temp file, same pattern as the `check-checklists` helper. Always write `implementation-log.md` and `checklists/*.md` as UTF-8 without BOM + LF.

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore (only then; if no Dockerfile* present, skip and do NOT log missing .dockerignore as FAIL — avoids noisy verification)
   - Check if supabase/ exists → ensure .gitignore contains `supabase/.temp/` and `.supabase/` / `.temp/` (Supabase CLI creates these on `npx supabase link`; otherwise `git status` is noisy — see `templates/supabase-README.md`)
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`

   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration — if the feature touches `config/services.php` (Laravel) and adds `env('FOO_API_URL')`, run `.pandawa/scripts/powershell/sync-env-example.ps1 -Fix` (or `scripts/bash/sync-env-example.sh --fix`) to keep `.env.example` in sync, so VPS deploy does not miss the var.
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints — for a sport/provider without official API (provisional), reuse the template `.pandawa/templates/laravel/ProvisionalService.php.template` (cache 3h, timeout 15s, scrape branch + static fallback) instead of reinventing the MPL/futsal pattern.
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation
   - **Mimicry Principle (match existing patterns, don't reinvent)**: in a codebase that already has code, do NOT write a task's implementation from a blank-slate description — first find the nearest existing example of the same kind of thing (an existing controller, service, model, migration, test, error handler, logger call, auth guard) and **mimic its structure, naming, imports, and conventions**. New code should look like it was written by whoever wrote the surrounding code: same error-handling shape, same logging style, same validation approach, same file/module layout. This produces code that fits the project (and passes the field-parity/architecture gates below) far more reliably than inventing a fresh style. Deviate from an existing pattern only when the task explicitly requires it, and say so when you do. On a genuinely greenfield project with no example to copy, follow plan.md and the constitution instead.
   - **Supabase grants are manual**: `supabase/*_grants.sql` cannot be applied via `SupabaseService` REST (`service_role` over HTTP gives `42501`). Treat the Apply task as manual: Dashboard SQL Editor or `npx supabase db execute --file supabase/..._grants.sql --linked` / `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f ...` (see `.pandawa/templates/supabase-README.md` — copy to `supabase/README.md` in the target project if Supabase is used). Split tasks: `T00x Apply grants (manual)` vs `T00y Verify via tinker/SELECT`.

8. **Phase verification gate** (run after EVERY phase, before moving on — this prevents error chains):
   - Run the project's cheapest available checks in this order: type check / compile (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`, `mvn compile`), then lint/formatter (for Laravel: run `pint` **fix first**, then `pint --test` — `pint --test` fails on `new_with_parentheses, fully_qualified_strict_types` after generation, so auto-fix before gate; do not treat the first `pint --test` failure as a gate failure without trying `pint`), then build, then the tests relevant to the phase.
   - **Keep gate output compact** (token thrift): this gate runs after every phase, so do NOT paste full build/lint/test logs into the run. Collapse passing/framework noise to counts; keep verbatim only the failing messages, assertions, and stack traces needed to diagnose and fix (same output-compression rule as `/pandawa.test`).
   - **Self-fix loop**: if a check fails, fix the error and re-run — up to 3 attempts per distinct error. Actually fix errors; never just report a recommendation and move on. If an error survives 3 attempts, record it in implementation-log.md as UNRESOLVED with your best diagnosis and continue only if later phases don't depend on it; otherwise stop and report.
   - **Source-conformance check** (the "matches the PDF" gate — run whenever a phase touches an entity, migration, DTO, contract, or FE type): compare the generated artifacts back to the source resource model via the digest under `FEATURE_DIR/inputs/` and `data-model.md`'s conformance checklist. Verify: every resource → table, every sub-resource → child table, every attribute → column (exact name/type/cardinality), every enum/state type present with exactly the source's values kept per resource — **nothing missing, renamed, invented, or simplified**. Any merge/flatten must be a deviation explicitly recorded in `data-model.md` and backed by a lossless mapper; an **unrecorded deviation is a gate failure**. This is cheap (compare against the text digest, not the raw PDF) and catches drift early, before it compounds into a rebuild.
   - **BE/FE/DB field-parity check** (run whenever a phase touches an entity, DTO, mapper, contract, or FE type/form): build ONE field inventory per resource from `contracts/` — the TMF wire contract is the source of truth for names, types, casing, and required/optional — then reconcile all three layers against it:
     - **API DTO ↔ contract**: every field name, type, casing (`camelCase`, `@type`/`@baseType`/`@schemaLocation`), and required/optional flag matches the contract exactly. A single mismatch (e.g. `unitCost` vs `costItemAmount`) causes cascading 400 errors — catch it here, not at runtime.
     - **DB ↔ contract via mapper**: by default the storage model in `data-model.md` mirrors the source, so it maps to the contract directly. Where `data-model.md` records an approved deviation (merged tables, flattened value objects, child tables), verify a mapper reassembles the full wire contract **losslessly** — every contract field produced, every column / child row consumed, nothing dropped, no orphan column. If a deviation merges sub-types with different lifecycles (e.g. `ActualCostItem` vs `ProjectedCostItem` states), verify state transitions are validated **per sub-type**, not against one combined enum.
     - **FE ↔ DTO**: `types.ts`, form fields, and the FormMapper use the same field names/types as the DTO; enumerations (state lifecycles) match, and per-subtype enums are not conflated.
     - On any mismatch, apply the self-fix loop above. A field present in one layer but unaccounted for in another is a **gate failure**, not a warning.
   - **BE→FE operation-coverage check** (run whenever a phase touches a controller, backend service method, or FE service/page — separate from the field-parity check above, which only verifies shared fields match, not that every operation exists on both sides): build ONE operation inventory per resource from the backend implementation (every exposed endpoint/controller method — CRUD plus custom actions like approve/cancel/export) and reconcile the frontend against it:
     - **FE service layer**: every backend operation has a corresponding function in the FE service file (`service/*.ts`), using the same route, method, and parameters as the backend controller.
     - **FE UI trigger**: every FE service function is actually invoked from a page/component (button, menu item, form submit, row action) — a service function nobody calls is as much a gap as a missing one.
     - An operation intentionally not exposed in the UI (e.g. an internal/system-only endpoint) is not a gap **only if** `data-model.md` or the spec records it as out-of-scope for FE; otherwise treat it as missing and implement it.
     - On any mismatch, apply the self-fix loop above. A backend operation with no FE service function, or an FE service function with no UI trigger, is a **gate failure**, not a warning.
   - **Visual composition check** (run whenever a phase adds or edits a page component. A domain profile, if active, defines FE-011 in its frontend constitution and may exceed this; **when no profile is active, this checklist IS the standard** — apply it against the project's own or greenfield design tokens, so a no-profile project still comes out designed, not basic). This is two passes, not one — the checklist alone is not sufficient:
     - **Pass A — element checklist**: for every list/overview/dashboard-landing page touched in this phase, confirm it is not a bare, flat composition — specifically: a stat/KPI summary row is present above the main table/grid; the empty state is icon/illustration + heading + helper text + primary CTA (never bare "No data" text); the loading state is a shaped skeleton, not a bare spinner, whenever the final layout is known; icons for the same status/entity/nav concept match what earlier pages in this feature already used; and the page has at least one tint/gradient/accent visual anchor instead of being built entirely from flat white/plain surfaces. Also confirm it uses the **Existing Design System** detected in Step 3, not a second/unrelated component library.
       **Beyond "not bare" — the polish bar** (what separates a page that looks *designed* from a merely functional one; enforce it especially when no profile is guiding the look, since that is where output defaults to basic): each KPI/stat tile carries a tinted icon chip + numeral + label + a trend/delta indicator or a small inline sparkline — a plain label+number tile is a fail; status/severity renders as a colored semantic chip (status dot + label) with a leading entity icon per row, never plain text; exactly one area per page spends the brand accent (header, featured stat, or primary CTA) with the rest kept neutral; grouped content sits on cards with deliberate soft elevation and a consistent radius, not flat borderless boxes; spacing follows one scale and columns of figures use tabular numerals. Every color resolves to a design token — never a hardcoded hex.
     - **Pass B — actually look at it rendered**: a checklist can pass while the page still looks bad (cramped spacing, clashing colors, misaligned grid, awkward proportions) — code-only review cannot catch that. Start the project's dev server and open each page touched in this phase in a browser (screenshot it), for at least one representative viewport. If the frontend is a Module-Federation remote that can't render standalone, render it through its host shell (or a Storybook/harness that provides `common_remote`) rather than expecting the remote's own dev server to show the page — a remote that 404s or renders blank on its own is a rendering-setup gap to fix, not a reason to skip Pass B or to mark it passed. Judge it holistically: spacing/whitespace rhythm, visual hierarchy, alignment/grid consistency, color harmony and contrast, and overall polish relative to sibling pages already in the app — not just "does it have a stat card". Then run this concrete **"offside" checklist** on each screenshot — any single failure is a gate failure:
       1. **No overflow/clipping**: no content spills outside its container, no unintended horizontal scrollbar, no text truncated or overlapping.
       2. **Alignment**: elements sit on a consistent grid — no control that's off-center or a few pixels out of line with its row/column, no ragged card edges.
       3. **Spacing scale**: gaps/padding follow one consistent scale (design-system spacing tokens) — nothing cramped, nothing with a randomly huge gap.
       4. **Color from tokens**: every color traces to a design token — no clashing/off-palette hue, no stray hardcoded color; status/entity colors match sibling pages.
       5. **Responsive**: re-check at one narrower viewport (e.g. tablet width) — the layout reflows without breaking, clipping, or overlapping.
       If something reads as visually rough even though Pass A passed, that is still a **gate failure**; fix it via the self-fix loop before moving on.
     - **Non-interactive/headless sessions** (CI, `pandawa run`, no browser tooling available): the rendered Pass B cannot run — say so explicitly in the phase report ("visual rendering not verified — no browser available in this session") instead of silently skipping it or implying it was checked, and never claim Pass B passed without having actually rendered the page. BUT still enforce what can be checked statically: if the active profile ships a static FE-011 linter (e.g. its `validation/fe011-lint.*`), run it over the pages touched this phase and treat any ERROR finding as a gate failure (fix via the self-fix loop). This keeps visual-composition and design-token rules enforced even when no human is watching.
     - Treat a page that's functionally correct but visually bare or rough (default library styling, no summary context, plain-text empty state, or a rendered result that just looks off) as a **gate failure**, not a warning — apply the self-fix loop above to add the missing element(s)/fix the composition before marking the phase complete.
   - Never declare a phase complete while its verification gate fails.

9. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails — but a *path resolution* failure follows the rules in step 1 (skip and continue, don't abort the run)
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

10. Completion validation:
    - Verify all required tasks are completed
    - **Verify per requirement, with evidence**: iterate every `FR-###` and `SC-###` from spec.md and confirm the implementation satisfies it, citing the concrete file / endpoint / test that fulfills each — not a blanket "matches the spec". List any FR/SC that is unmet or only partially met as an explicit gap. Re-confirm the spec's Assumptions still hold, and flag any that were invalidated during implementation.
    - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
    - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan (including Architecture Type/Integration Target) and the constitution
    - Report final status with summary of completed work, including:
      - Changed-files summary (from implementation-log.md) so the user can see exactly what this run touched
      - Any UNRESOLVED errors with diagnosis
      - Rollback instructions: the checkpoint HEAD recorded in step 3 and the command to revert (e.g., `git diff <checkpoint>..HEAD`, `git checkout <checkpoint> -- <path>` for a single file, or `git reset --hard <checkpoint>` for everything — warn that reset discards all changes)

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/pandawa.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.
